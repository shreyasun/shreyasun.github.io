        <p>The Academy for Global Citizenship (AGC) is a Chicago public school and teacher training institute that utilizes a teaching model involving social justice, environmental education, entrepreneurship, dual language learning, and health and wellness, in an effort to address educational, environmental, and racial health care inequities.</p>

        <h1 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold">Project Objective ðŸŒŸ</h1>
        <p>AGC currently has student testing data in multiple large datasets, for Math and ELA subjects, which are subdivided into further subject domains. These datasets are from i-Ready, an educational platform. They would like to utilize this data for insights to understand student performance and make adaptations as necessary. As such, they have requested our team to clean, organize, and visualize this data in a way that would provide insights into student performance holistically and individually, and put everything into an organized dashboard. This dashboard would serve as an educational tool for AGC students, staff and community members to understand how AGCâ€™s teaching models are positively impacting AGC site and community, ultimately impacting 1500+ individuals.</p>
